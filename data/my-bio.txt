I am a PhD candidate at the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University where I work with Professor Hartmut Geyer. My research interests span optimal control theory, reinforcement learning and multibody physics simulations. During my PhD, I have developed hierarchical control methods to alleviate the curse of dimensionality in policy optimization. My research inculcates methods from classical controls in optimal control and reinforcement learning.

I have received a Masters in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon University working with Professor Manuela Veloso. I have a Bachelors with Honors in Mechanical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. I have had the pleasure of interning at NVIDIA Robotics (2019) and at the Learning Algorithms and Systems Lab (LASA) at EPFL (2015).
